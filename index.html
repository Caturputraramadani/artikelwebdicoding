        <h3> The Privilege of the Indonesian Sea</h3>
        <p>Many people already know that Indonesia's sea area is 70% of its area. Indonesia also has 17,504 islands with the second longest coastline in the world. Asian Development data for 2009 shows that Indonesia's coastal areas are home to thousands of marine species.
          In other words, Indonesian seas provide an important source of protein which has traditionally been the main food source. From several studies it is known that until now fish has consistently contributed more than 10% of total food protein consumption and more than 50% of animal food protein intake in this country. <i>sumber:mongabay</i></p>

      <h3>Indonesian Sea Observation</h3>
      <p>The role of the Indonesian sea is so large, it needs to be supported by a well-integrated monitoring and observation system. COMMONS (The WMO-IOC Joint Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology in situ Observations Program Support Centre), succeeded in mapping the locations of observation system platforms around the world. From these maps, it can be seen that Indonesia does not have a marine observation system or observation platform. Unfortunately, the Indonesian government has not (yet) observed a long-term investment to maintain the Indonesian seas. Currently, the national marine observation system (ocean and coastal) is not a priority for the country. The existing system is not well maintained (sustained) due to the unavailability of a budget and is often affected by changes in state priorities. Indonesia's limited technology and human resources also complement the absence of a marine observation system, so Indonesia is still dependent on products from other countries. Observation systems that still depend on other countries, which are usually carried out through international cooperation, cannot record real-time data for reasons of maintaining national security interests. <i>sumber:mongabay</i></p>
